          Kosovo is a land where old and new meet in harmony.

        <h3>Food & Cuisine</h3>
        <p>
          Kosovo’s cuisine is full of flavors that combine Balkan, Ottoman, and Mediterranean influences. Dishes like flija, a layered pastry cooked slowly over fire, and pite filled with cheese, spinach, or meat are traditional favorites. Grilled meat and fresh dairy products also play a big role in daily meals. Sharing food is an important part of hospitality in Kosovo.
